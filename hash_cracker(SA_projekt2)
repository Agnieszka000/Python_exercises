# Project from Sekurak Academy webinar "Czy Pythonem można hakować wszystko?"
# You broke into a database of a huge corporation.
# You manged to enumerate all the employees and their hashes.
# Your task is to break Administrator's hash, but you have access only to Python.
# Unleash dictionary attack and use /usr/share/wordlists/john.lst as your wordlist.

    for password in wordlist:
        # Skip "#!comment:" comments in the wordlist:
        if password[0] == "#":
            continue
        # Remove leading/trailing whitespace:
        password = password.strip() 
        hashed_password = hashlib.md5(password.encode())
        # The output of the "hashlib" is a string of bytes, that's why it must be converted into a human-readable form (hexadeximals).
        # The hexadecimal representation is a standard way to display hash values:
        hashed_password = hashed_password.hexdigest().lower()
        if hashed_password == admin_hash:
